# QA Python Assessment 1

This is the first QA Python Assessment.

You have **2 hours** to complete as many questions as possible and submit your answers.

In order to complete this assessment, you must do the following:

1. Fork the repository to make a version under your own GitHub account.

2. Clone your forked repository (NOT the original repo!).

3. As you complete each answer, commit your changes with the following commands:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "completed question one/two/three/etc."
    ```

4. When the two hours are up, push up your answers to GitHub with:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

You **must** make your final commit *before* your 2 hours are up. Any commits after the 2 hour deadline will *not* be counted.

**Remember:** your *commits* are what are timestamped, **not** your pushes.

Good luck!
